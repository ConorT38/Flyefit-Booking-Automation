# Flyefit Booking Automation

Flyefit Gyms over Ireland have implemented a "Gym class/session booking" system due to COVID-19. 
This script allows the user to setup a scheduled automated booking, so that they don't have to remember to book that 6:30 gym session.

## Pre-requisites
<ul>
<li>+ Python 3.x</li>
<li>+ Selenium Module</li>
<li>+ Chrome v84+</li>
